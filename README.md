# domtoms website

## Introduction
This repository contains the source code for my website, domtoms.com. This website mainly serves as a hub for links to my other platforms, such as LinkedIn and GitHub etc.

## About
My website is written entirely in HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I chose to not use a framework such as React or Angular because they are not necassary for this kind of website. While JavaScript is used to add some flare to the website, the website will function without JavaScript enabled. It is important the web is accessable on browsers such as W3M or even on older browsers such as IE7.

## Hidden Game
Clicking on my name will activate a hidden game. Just like the rest of my website, the game is rendered entirely in Unicode text.
